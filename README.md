# AMRrulesCuration

<img src="AMRrules_logo.png" width="200" align="right">

This repository is the home of the ESGEM-AMR Working Group, which focuses on curating organism-specific rule sets for interpreting AMR genotypes under the [AMRrules](https://github.com/interpretAMR/AMRrules) framework.

The goal of AMRrules is to develop interpretive standards for AMR genotypes, akin to the interpretive standards developed by [EUCAST](https://www.eucast.org/) and [CLSI](https://clsi.org/) for antimicrobial susceptibility phenotyping.

An overview of the concept, with example data structures and code, is available in the [AMRrules](https://github.com/interpretAMR/AMRrules) repository.

We have partnered with [ESGEM, the ESCMID Study Group on Epidemiological Markers](https://www.escmid.org/esgem/), to form an ESGEM-AMR Working Group to curate organism-specific rule sets. 
* A detailed description of the Working Group and the overall AMRrules approach is available [here](https://github.com/interpretAMR/AMRrulesCuration/blob/main/ESGEM-AMR%20Working%20Group.pdf), including scope, plans and timeline.
* Technical guidance for curation of rule sets is available [here](https://github.com/interpretAMR/AMRrulesCuration/blob/main/ESGEM-AMR%20Technical%20Guidance.pdf), this is a work in progress and will be refined as we go.


## Working Group Members

The convenors of the ESGEM-AMR Working Group are Kat Holt (LSHTM), Natacha Couto (ESGEM Chair), and Jane Hawkey (Monash, leading bioinformatics development).

A call for members was launched at the ESGEM General Meeting on April 29, and we are currently taking expressions of interest to join the Working Group. Membership of the working group is open to anyone with relevant expertise, you do not have to be an ESGEM member.

If after reading the documents above you are interested to join, please register your interest and let us know what organism/s you have expertise in, using [this form](https://forms.gle/QjvQNuB3vCHGMiiA7), by June 2.

Following a review of registrations, individuals will be formally invited to join and asked to sign a [Memborandum of Understanding](https://github.com/interpretAMR/AMRrulesCuration/blob/main/ESGEM-AMR%20MOU.pdf) and [Code of Ethics](https://github.com/interpretAMR/AMRrulesCuration/blob/main/ESGEM-AMR%20Code%20of%20Ethics.pdf).

## Partners

We are partnering with EUCAST to ensure alignment of the AMRrules approach with the [EUCAST Subcommittee on WGS and Phenotypic AST](https://www.eucast.org/organization/subcommittees/wgs_and_phenotypic_testing) (including their [first report (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2016.11.012) and ongoing updates), as well as important EUCAST concepts and guidance including [Expected Phenotypes](https://www.eucast.org/expert_rules_and_expected_phenotypes/expected_phenotypes), [Expert Rules](https://www.eucast.org/expert_rules_and_expected_phenotypes), [wildtype distributions and ECOFFS](https://mic.eucast.org/), and [Resistance Mechanisms](https://www.eucast.org/resistance_mechanisms).

We are keen to partner with other allied organisations and initiatives, please [get in touch](https://www.escmid.org/contact/) if you'd like to discuss.
