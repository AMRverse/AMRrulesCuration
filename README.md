# AMRrulesCuration

This repository is the home of the ESGEM-AMR Working Group, which focuses on curating organism-specific rule sets for interpreting AMR genotypes under the [AMRrules](https://github.com/interpretAMR/AMRrules) framework.

Our goal is to develop interpretive standards for AMR genotypes, akin to the interpretive standards developed by EUCAST and CLSI for antimicrobial susceptibility phenotyping.

An overview of the concept, with example data structures and code, is available in the [AMRrules](https://github.com/interpretAMR/AMRrules) repository.

We are partnering with ESGEM, the ESCMID Study Group on Epidemiological Markers, to form an ESGEM-AMR Working Group to curate organism-specific rule sets. Membership of the working group is open to anyone with relevant expertise, you do not have to be an ESGEM member.

A detailed description of the ESGEM-AMR Working Group is available [here](https://github.com/interpretAMR/AMRrulesCuration/blob/main/ESGEM-AMR%20Working%20Group.pdf), including scope / plans / timeline. Technical guidance for curation of rule sets is available [here](https://github.com/interpretAMR/AMRrulesCuration/blob/main/ESGEM-AMR%20Technical%20Guidance.pdf).

If after reading these documents you are interested to join the working group, please register your interest, and let us know what organism/s you have expertise in, using [this form](https://forms.gle/QjvQNuB3vCHGMiiA7), by June 2.
