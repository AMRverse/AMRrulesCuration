✅ All gene values are valid

Now checking for combinatorial rules in gene column...
✅ All gene combinatorial rule IDs are valid

Checking nodeID, refseq accession, GenBank accession and HMM accession columns...
✅ All rows contain at least one value in one of these columns.
❌ One or more accessions aren't present in either the NCBI Reference Gene Catalog (for nodeID, refseq accession and genbank accession) or the NCBI Reference HMM Catalog (for HMM accession). Empty cells must be specified by '-'.

Invalid nodeID accessions values:

Invalid refseq accessions values:
Row 160: WP_001170306.1
Row 168: 

Invalid genbank accessions values:

Invalid HMM accessions values:

Checking ARO accession column...
✅ All ARO accession values are valid and exist in the CARD ontology

Checking mutation column...
✅ All mutation values are valid

Checking  variation type column...
✅ All variation type values are valid

Checking mutation and variation type columns are compatible...
❌ 1 rows have failed the check
Row 147: Mutation must start with 'c.-', 'c.(-', or 'c.[-' if variation type is 'Promoter variant detected'. The - symbol indicates the position before the start of the gene where the mutation occurs.

Checking context column...
✅ All context values are valid
✅ All context and mutation values are concordant

Checking drug and drug class columns...
❌ 1 rows have failed the check
One of drug or drug class must contain a value that is not empty, NA or '-'. Values must be listed in the CARD drug name ontology, as per card_drug_names.tsv. Drugs and their classes should be given in all lower case.
Row 160: Both drug and drug class are empty. At least one of these columns must contain a valid CARD drug or drug class name.

Checking  phenotype column...
✅ All phenotype values are valid

Checking phenotype and context columns are concordant...
✅ All phenotype and context values are concordant

Checking  clinical category column...
✅ All clinical category values are valid

Checking  breakpoint column...
✅ All breakpoint values are valid

Checking clinical category and breakpoint columns...
✅ All clinical category and breakpoint values are concordant

Checking  breakpoint standard column...
❌ 1 rows have failed the check
breakpoint standard column must contain a value that is not NA or '-'
Row 160: -

Unique breakpoint standard values: EUCAST v14.0 (2024), -, ECOFF (May 2025), EUCAST v15.0 (2025), EUCAST Expected Resistant Phenotypes v1.2 (2023)
