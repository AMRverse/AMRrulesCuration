Checking that all required columns for spec v0.5 are present...

Continuing to validate values in each column...

Checking ruleID column...
All rule IDs have passed auto validation
✅ All values are valid
Rule prefix: STA

Checking organism column...
✅ All organism names passed validation

Unique organism names: s__Staphylococcus aureus

Checking gene column...
✅ All gene values are valid

Now checking for combinatorial rules in gene column...
✅ All gene combinatorial rule IDs are valid

Checking nodeID, refseq accession, GenBank accession and HMM accession columns...
❌ 1 rows have failed the check because at least one of either nodeID, refseq accession, GenBank accession and HMM accession must contain a value. The only exception to this is if the variation type is 'Combination', in which case all of these columns can be '-'.
Row 2
❌ One or more accessions aren't present in either the NCBI Reference Gene Catalog (for nodeID, refseq accession and genbank accession) or the NCBI Reference HMM Catalog (for HMM accession). Empty cells must be specified by '-'.
