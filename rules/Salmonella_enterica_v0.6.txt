Efflux components MdsB and MdsC or TolC are also required for function. Chloramphenicol has been described as a substrate for efflux, but no evidence of clinical resistance associated with wildtype expression and this is not an expected resistance."

Although S. enterica wildtype MIC distributions do not exceed Enterobacterales breakpoints, EUCAST expert rules recommend always reporting Salmonella as resistant to aminoglycosides, because ""evidence from in vitro, animal models, and limited human treatment experience that aminoglycosides are ineffective in the treatment of invasive Salmonella infections"". The specific role of this gene in this clinical phenomenon has not been experimentally demonstrated and there is no evidence that lack of the gene would result in susceptibility."
