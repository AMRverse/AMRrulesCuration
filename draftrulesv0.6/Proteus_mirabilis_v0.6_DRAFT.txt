This chromosomal determinant actively transports tetracycline from the cytoplasm using proton motive force, conferring intrinsic resistance to tetracycline and related compounds. The tet(J) system shows unique non-divergent transcription pattern unlike other tetracycline determinants and is regulated by a TetR repressor with tetracycline acting as inducer. Clinical isolates consistently show 100% resistance to tetracycline. (The specific regulatory mutations that might modulate efflux activity in clinical isolates are not well described.)"

Wildtype core gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). This chromosomal gene catalyzes acetyl-CoA-dependent acetylation of chloramphenicol at the 3-hydroxyl group, preventing ribosomal binding. The catA gene exhibits a novel reversible resistance phenotype through phase variation involving an invertible promoter, where resistant colonies revert to sensitivity after approximately 150 generations without antibiotic pressure. (The specific molecular triggers and frequency of phase switching in clinical isolates are not well described.)"

The RppA/RppB two-component regulatory system (homologous to PmrA/PhoP systems) coordinates expression of the arnBCADTEF operon, pmrI, and eptC genes. These enzymes add L-Ara4N to lipid A phosphate groups and transfer phosphoethanolamine to both lipid A and core LPS (O-6 position of L-glycero-D-manno-heptose II), reducing net negative charge and preventing polymyxin binding while maintaining membrane integrity. Clinical isolates show 100% intrinsic resistance to both polymyxin B and colistin, with knockout studies demonstrating >10,000-fold increases in susceptibility when key components are inactivated. (The environmental signals that modulate RppA/RppB activity, relative contribution of each pathway component, and potential strain-to-strain variation in LPS modification efficiency are not well described.)"

Unlike other Enterobacterales that require nfsA/nfsB to convert nitrofurantoin to toxic metabolites, P. mirabilis lacks these genes entirely, rendering the drug inactive. Clinical isolates consistently show 100% resistance with MICs >128 mg/L. This mechanism is well-established through clinical phenotyping and inference from mechanistic studies in other species. (Direct genomic confirmation of nitroreductase gene absence in P. mirabilis through comprehensive comparative genomics has not been explicitly published, representing a gap between established clinical phenotype and molecular characterization.)"

Key components include decreased PBP1a expression, reduced PBP2 affinity for imipenem, loss of major porins (37-40 kDa), and potential overexpression of ImpR (chitobiose porin homologue). These intrinsic mechanisms result in 2-8 fold increases in carbapenem MICs compared to other Enterobacteriaceae, though clinical resistance requiring additional acquired mechanisms. (The specific mutations or regulatory changes that lead to PBP alterations and the relative contribution of each resistance component in clinical isolates are not well described.)"
