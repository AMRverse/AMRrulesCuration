Checking mutation and variation type columns are compatible...
❌ 2 rows have failed the check
Row 147: Mutation must start with 'c.-', 'c.(-', or 'c.[-' if variation type is 'Promoter variant detected'. The - symbol indicates the position before the start of the gene where the mutation occurs.
Row 150: Mutation must start with 'c.-', 'c.(-', or 'c.[-' if variation type is 'Promoter variant detected'. The - symbol indicates the position before the start of the gene where the mutation occurs.

Checking context column...
❌ 2 rows have failed the check
Context column must contain either 'core' or 'acquired' and cannot be empty. If variation type is 'Combination', context must be '-'.
Row 149: acquired; If variation type is "Combination", context must be "-".
Row 152: acquired; If variation type is "Combination", context must be "-".
✅ All context and mutation values are concordant

Checking drug and drug class columns...
❌ 53 rows have failed the check
One of drug or drug class must contain a value that is not empty, NA or '-'. Values must be listed in the CARD drug name ontology, as per card_drug_names.tsv. Drugs and their classes should be given in all lower case.

Checking  phenotype column...
✅ All phenotype values are valid

Checking phenotype and context columns are concordant...
❌ 2 rows have failed the check
If the gene context is a 'core' gene, the expected phenotype should generally be 'wildtype', unless the rule refers to a specific variant of the core gene for which there is evidence of a nonwildtype phenotype (in which case the variant should be coded as 'acquired' not core)
Row 162: nonwildtype and core
Row 164: nonwildtype and core

Checking  clinical category column...
✅ All clinical category values are valid

Checking  breakpoint column...
✅ All breakpoint values are valid

Checking clinical category and breakpoint columns...
