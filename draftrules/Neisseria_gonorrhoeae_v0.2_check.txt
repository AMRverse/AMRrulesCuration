❌ 111 rows have failed the check
If the gene context is a 'core' gene, the expected phenotype should generally be 'wildtype', unless the rule refers to a specific variant of the core gene for which there is evidence of a nonwildtype phenotype (in which case the variant should be coded as 'acquired' not core)
