Invalid HMM accessions values:

Checking ARO accession column...
✅ All ARO accession values are valid and exist in the CARD ontology

Checking mutation column...
✅ All mutation values are valid

Checking  variation type column...
✅ All variation type values are valid

Checking mutation and variation type columns are compatible...
✅ All mutation and variation type values are compatible

Checking context column...
✅ All context values are valid
✅ All context and mutation values are concordant

Checking drug and drug class columns...
❌ 1 rows have failed the check
One of drug or drug class must contain a value that is not empty, NA or '-'. Values must be listed in the CARD drug name ontology, as per card_drug_names.tsv. Drugs and their classes should be given in all lower case.
Row 15: Drug class streptogramins is not a valid CARD drug class name.

Checking  phenotype column...

Checking clinical category and breakpoint columns...
❌ 9 rows have failed the check
Row 24: If clinical category is 'S', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC <', 'MIC <=', or 'disk >'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.
Row 25: If clinical category is 'S', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC <', 'MIC <=', or 'disk >'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.
Row 30: If clinical category is 'S', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC <', 'MIC <=', or 'disk >'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.
