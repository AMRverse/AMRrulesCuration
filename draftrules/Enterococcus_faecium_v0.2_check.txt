Invalid HMM accessions values:

Checking ARO accession column...
✅ All ARO accession values are valid and exist in the CARD ontology

Checking mutation column...
✅ All mutation values are valid

Checking  variation type column...
✅ All variation type values are valid

Checking mutation and variation type columns are compatible...
✅ All mutation and variation type values are compatible

Checking context column...
✅ All context values are valid
✅ All context and mutation values are concordant

Checking drug and drug class columns...
✅ All drug and drug class values are valid and listed in the CARD drug name ontology.

Checking  phenotype column...
✅ All phenotype values are valid

Checking phenotype and context columns are concordant...
✅ All phenotype and context values are concordant

Checking  clinical category column...
✅ All clinical category values are valid

Checking  breakpoint column...
✅ All breakpoint values are valid

Checking clinical category and breakpoint columns...
❌ 3 rows have failed the check
Row 7: If clinical category is 'R', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC >', 'MIC >=', or 'disk <'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.
Row 10: If clinical category is 'R', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC >', 'MIC >=', or 'disk <'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.
Row 17: If clinical category is 'S', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC <', 'MIC <=', or 'disk >'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.

Checking  breakpoint standard column...
✅ All breakpoint standard values are valid

Unique breakpoint standard values: not applicable, ECOFF ID, ECOFF

Checking  PMID column...
✅ All PMID values are valid

Checking evidence code column...
The following evidence codes are new and not currently in the list of suggested values:
ECO:0001583 small interfering RNA knockdown evidence

❌ 1 rows have failed the check. Each rule must have an evidence code and not be empty. If there are multiplegit  evidence codes for a row, they must be separated by a ',', not by a new line. Evidence codes must start with 'ECO:'.
Row 19: ECO:0001583 small interfering RNA knockdown evidence

Checking evidence grade and limitations columns...
✅ All evidence grades are valid
✅ All evidence limitations are valid
