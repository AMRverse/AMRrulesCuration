Checking that all required columns for spec v0.5 are present...

Continuting to validate values in each column...

Checking ruleID column...
All rule IDs have passed auto validation
✅ All values are valid

Checking clinical category and breakpoint columns...
❌ 9 rows have failed the check
Row 3: If clinical category is 'R', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC >', 'MIC >=', or 'disk <'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.
Row 8: If clinical category is 'R', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC >', 'MIC >=', or 'disk <'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.
Row 9: If clinical category is 'R', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC >', 'MIC >=', or 'disk <'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.
Row 10: If clinical category is 'R', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC >', 'MIC >=', or 'disk <'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.
Row 11: If clinical category is 'R', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC >', 'MIC >=', or 'disk <'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.
Row 12: If clinical category is 'R', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC >', 'MIC >=', or 'disk <'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.
Row 14: If clinical category is 'R', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC >', 'MIC >=', or 'disk <'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.
Row 15: If clinical category is 'R', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC >', 'MIC >=', or 'disk <'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.
Row 16: If clinical category is 'R', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC >', 'MIC >=', or 'disk <'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.
