Checking ARO accession column...
✅ All ARO accession values are valid and exist in the CARD ontology

Checking mutation column...
✅ All mutation values are valid

Checking  variation type column...
✅ All variation type values are valid

Checking mutation and variation type columns are compatible...
✅ All mutation and variation type values are compatible

Checking context column...
✅ All context values are valid
✅ All context and mutation values are concordant

Checking drug and drug class columns...
❌ 3 rows have failed the check
One of drug or drug class must contain a value that is not empty, NA or '-'. Values must be listed in the CARD drug name ontology, as per card_drug_names.tsv. Drugs and their classes should be given in all lower case.
Row 82: Drug class  is not a valid CARD drug class name.
Row 83: Drug class  is not a valid CARD drug class name.
Row 84: Drug class  is not a valid CARD drug class name.

Checking  phenotype column...
✅ All phenotype values are valid

Checking phenotype and context columns are concordant...
❌ 48 rows have failed the check
If the gene context is a 'core' gene, the expected phenotype should generally be 'wildtype', unless the rule refers to a specific variant of the core gene for which there is evidence of a nonwildtype phenotype (in which case the variant should be coded as 'acquired' not core)
