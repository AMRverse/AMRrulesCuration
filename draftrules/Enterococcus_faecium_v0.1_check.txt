Checking that all required columns for spec v0.5 are present...

Continuing to validate values in each column...

Checking ruleID column...
All rule IDs have passed auto validation
✅ All values are valid
Rule prefix: EFM

Checking organism column...
✅ All organism names passed validation

Unique organism names: s__Enterococcus_B faecium

Checking gene column...
✅ All gene values are valid

Now checking for combinatorial rules in gene column...
✅ All gene combinatorial rule IDs are valid

Checking nodeID, refseq accession, GenBank accession and HMM accession columns...
✅ All rows contain at least one value in one of these columns.
❌ One or more accessions aren't present in either the NCBI Reference Gene Catalog (for nodeID, refseq accession and genbank accession) or the NCBI Reference HMM Catalog (for HMM accession). Empty cells must be specified by '-'.

Row 20: AFC64635.1
Row 21: AFC64635.1
Row 22: AFC63082.1
Row 23: AFC63082.1

Invalid HMM accessions values:

Checking ARO accession column...
✅ All ARO accession values are valid and exist in the CARD ontology

Checking mutation column...
✅ All mutation values are valid

Checking  variation type column...
✅ All variation type values are valid

Checking mutation and variation type columns are compatible...
✅ All mutation and variation type values are compatible

Checking context column...
✅ All context values are valid
✅ All context and mutation values are concordant

Checking drug and drug class columns...
✅ All drug and drug class values are valid and listed in the CARD drug name ontology.

Checking  phenotype column...
✅ All phenotype values are valid

Checking phenotype and context columns are concordant...
✅ All phenotype and context values are concordant

Checking  clinical category column...
✅ All clinical category values are valid

Checking  breakpoint column...
✅ All breakpoint values are valid

Checking clinical category and breakpoint columns...
❌ 3 rows have failed the check
Row 7: If clinical category is 'R', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC >', 'MIC >=', or 'disk <'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.
Row 10: If clinical category is 'R', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC >', 'MIC >=', or 'disk <'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.
Row 17: If clinical category is 'S', breakpoint should contain a value of 'MIC <', 'MIC <=', or 'disk >'. 'not applicable' is an allowed value if no breakpoint is available due to expected resistances.

Checking  breakpoint standard column...
✅ All breakpoint standard values are valid

Unique breakpoint standard values: ECOFF ID, ECOFF, not applicable

Checking  PMID column...
✅ All PMID values are valid

Checking evidence code column...
The following evidence codes are new and not currently in the list of suggested values:
ECO:0001583 small interfering RNA knockdown evidence

❌ 1 rows have failed the check. Each rule must have an evidence code and not be empty. If there are multiplegit  evidence codes for a row, they must be separated by a ',', not by a new line. Evidence codes must start with 'ECO:'.
Row 19: ECO:0001583 small interfering RNA knockdown evidence

Checking evidence grade and limitations columns...
✅ All evidence grades are valid
❌ 2 rows have failed the check
If evidence grade is 'moderate' or 'weak', evidence limitations column must contain one of the following values: lacks evidence for this species, lacks evidence for this genus, lacks evidence for this allele, lacks evidence of the degree to which MIC is affected, low clinical relevance, unknown clinical relevance, statistical geno/pheno evidence but no experimental evidence
Row 7: no amikacin MIC change in knockout strain compared to WT, no evidence of contribution to intrinsic resistance
Row 10: no netilmicin MIC change in knockout strain compared to WT, no evidence of contribution to intrinsic resistance
